<p><strong>STEP 5 &nbsp;- &nbsp;COMPLETE THE THIRD LAYER CORNERS</strong><br /><br />(1) First we will put the corners in the correct position (A).<br />You will now have either 0, 1 or ALL the corners pieces will be in their correct positions, either the right way up or reversed.<br />If one corner piece is in the correct corner turn the cube to that this&nbsp;<strong>correct corner</strong>&nbsp;is in the&nbsp;<strong>front top right</strong>&nbsp;position. The piece is in the correct position, BUT may not be turned the correct way around.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />Repeat the sequence until all the corners are in the correct position.</p>
<p><strong>Possible Problem:</strong>&nbsp;None of the corners is in the correct position.<br /><strong>Solution:</strong>&nbsp;Perform the steps in (A) once with&nbsp;ANY side facing you (YELLOW at the top). Now one corner will be in the correct position. Proceed with (A) above.</p>
<p>The next steps will turn the corners (one by one) the correct way and ultimately solve the cube.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: THIS ROUTINE MAY APPEAR TO UPSET THE REST OF THE CUBE. DO NOT DESPAIR AND KEEP THE SAME SIDE FACING YOU IT WILL ONLY BE SOLVED ONCE THE LAST CORNER IS ORIENTATED.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Repeat the moves until the YELLOW side of the corner piece is on top. You may have to do it 2-3 times.</p>
<p><br /><strong>KEEP THE SAME SIDE FACING YOU.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;Rotate the TOP LAYER until the next corner piece to be rotated is in the top right position. Repeat the above sequence until the YELLOW side of the corner that you are rotating is on top. Continue the process until the cube is complete.</p>
