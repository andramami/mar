<p id="whiteCorners"><br /><br /><em>Keeping white on top, turn the cube so that a different colour face (center) is toward you. Follow the above instructions again. Repeat with the other two faces until the white cross is complete. This step is quite intuitive; you can do it for sure but it does take a little practice. Just move the white edges to their places not messing up the ones already fixed.&emsp;</em>&nbsp;</p>
